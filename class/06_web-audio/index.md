#### Basics
The number of samles you have the better the quality

We are looking to capture audio in the range of 28Hz - 28kHz

The Nyquist Theorem states that you need twice as manny samples to get get a good waveform

Web Audio is filling arrays with numbers that represent waveforms

If you double a pitch it is an octave up

Any wave form can be created using a sum of sin waves\

A square wave only plays odd harmonics

We are usally dealing with 16-bit numbers, and we use those numebers to sample wave forms over time

#### Digital Music History

It all started at the Bell Labs, with the creation of C-Sound
  - Max Matthews was at the fore front, and he came up with the idea of using a graph structure for routing audio from one node to another, ultimatley reaching an output node
