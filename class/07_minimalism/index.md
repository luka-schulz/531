#### Quotes

"In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work.  When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art."  **Sol Lewitt - Artforum (June, 1967)**

"Modern works of art often call for prolonged continous close attention if one is to appreciate them. THe same is true of a gator baking in the sun on a mude bank ina swamp. Anything viewed makes demands."  **Samuel Beckett**
