#### How to Jam
Most jazz will start with a tune and a lead sheet
  - The sheet will contain notes and chords
  - The bass player will play the roots and fifths of the chords making up a melodic diddy

Musicians will trade 4s (or 8, and 16) and it becomes very spontaneous and interactive

#### How its done
Trumpet has a wirless microphone that sends the signal toa pitch tracker
  - Musical Instrument Digital Interface is passed to a tone generator
  - The computer sends infromation back to the tone generator and plays back
  - The computer is passed files with text files
  - Measure Population and Phrase Population are where the genetic algorithim comes into play
