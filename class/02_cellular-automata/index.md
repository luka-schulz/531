[Iannis Xenakis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf7sGbnsu2E "Iannis Xenakis") used cellular automotat in his composition *Horos* to inform his music wiriting

#### What is it?
Cells live on a grid, and each cell has a single state. Cells exist within neighborhoods, and each cell is goverened by a set of rules

cellstate at time t is a function of all the neighboring cells states form the prior iteration

The *Theory of Self-Reproducing Automota* was created by John Von Neumann (who was also closely linked with how computers are designed) in 1966
  - Inspired [Schelling's Model of Segregation](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/ "Schelling's Model of segregation")
  - Steven Wolfram wrote a book called a *[A New Kind of Science](http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/ "A New Kind of Science")* where he described different 8-bit cellular automota
  - Conway's Game of Life is one of the most famous implementations of cellular automota

*Toriodal* means wrapping
