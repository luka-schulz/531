#### History
In the 20th century, music trends began to change, there was a shift towards natural sounds (nature)

Thaddeus Cahill made the Teleharmonium which hypothetically promised live music streaming

Instead of adding things together, people began filtering sounds and boosting them
  - This was called subtractive synthesis
  - An example is the [Buchla Synth](https://www.schneidersladen.de/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/3/130115_7.jpg "Buchla Synth")
  - Another example is the [Minimoog](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0758/4003/products/Moog-Model-D-Main_2048x2048.JPG?v=1470767827 "Minimoog")
  
Music examples:
  - [Silver Apples Of The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G1hRNLlYpg "Silver Apples Of The Moon")
  - [Bradenburg 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_brandenburg_3.ogg "Bradenburg 3")

Web Audio:
  - Use the BiquadFilterNode takes a freqeuncy to cutoff at and a Q (the quality; boosts the end value near the end of the cutoff)
  - Uses the Biquad formula to affect audio
