#### Asthetic decissions

The design of this project was heavily influenced by the shader diffusion equation. I chose to go with a dark color scheme with neon colors to emulate cellular photography. As you adjust the feed and kill rate the coloring gettings more and more purple. Aurally, I chose to use the C Major scale due to it's popularity in western culture. It allows for users to quickly play simple tunes by ear or improvise.
